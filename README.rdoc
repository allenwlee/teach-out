== Teach-Out.com

Teach Out aims to simply fill the gap between elementary 
school teachers and parents.

We give teachers a one page app that allows them to 
send SMS texts, manage scheduled messages, and view
past texts without using their personal cell phone 
number or keeping track of dozens of parent and 
guardian contacts.
